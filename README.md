## Project notes ðŸŽ™

<p style="color:#7dd1f6;">This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses only the forked /mock folder from the original quadric-code-challenge repo.</p>
<p style="color:#e7abb9;">
Transparent png images were cut using screenshots and photoshop. ðŸ’¥
</p>
<p style="color:#c5c4c7">
Semantic UI React Grid widths stopped working, but kept using them for CSS declarations in place. 
 </p>
<p style="color:#c5c4c7">
Didn't add "Name" and "Created" Column headers because ran out of time. ðŸ’£
</p>

<p style="color:#c5c4c7">
Same for solid bottom border under column headers; ran out of time.  
</p>

<p style="color:#e7abb9;">
Set up some folder structure for larger project.
</p>

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ component

etc...
```

<p  style="color:#7dd1f6;">
Copied down the semantic-forest slate theme. Didn't implement. That's why all the craco content is here.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
<p style="color:#474747;font-style:italic">mostly Readme.md boilerplate below</p>
  
### `npm start-ui`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test-ui`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build-ui`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject-ui`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

(The following scripts are experimental for installing semantic-forest-ui themes via Craco. The requisite craco config file and package.json settings are in place to run the themes, but they don't work yet.) 


### `npm craco start`

### `npm craco build`

### `npm craco test`

### `npm craco eject`
